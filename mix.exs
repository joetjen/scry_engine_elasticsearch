      # === SCRY CORE ===
      # A local path dependency, not a Hex version constraint, since
      # scry_core isn't published to Hex yet -- this package implements
      # `Scry.Core.EngineBehaviour` and returns `Scry.Core.Query.t()`-
      # shaped data, so it's the real dependency, not test-only. Switch
      # to a `~> x.y` Hex requirement once scry_core is actually
      # published (impl_spec.md's own dependency-versions convention).

      # === HTTP CLIENT ===
      # No dedicated, actively-maintained Elasticsearch client exists
      # for this use case -- `snap` (the current best option) requires
      # a compile-time `use Snap.Cluster` module defined in the
      # *consuming* application, which doesn't fit this package's own
      # runtime-configured `Conn.open/1` convention (every other
      # `Scry.Engine.*` adapter opens a connection value at runtime, not
      # a module at compile time). Elasticsearch's own API is plain
      # JSON-over-HTTP with no client-specific protocol to speak, so a
      # generic HTTP client is the right fit -- `req` is unusually
      # well-suited here since it already auto-decodes a JSON response
      # body with no extra configuration.
